# Burger

This *#Eat The Burger*, :hamburger: app will allow users to view/add a name of a burger.  Then the user will be able click a button to say that they have devoured the burger.  There will be a list of burgers that have **not** been devoured as well as another list of **devoured** burgers.

I am very thankful for the learning I have accomplished during the work on this homework.  I have been a bit :weary: during this homework with errors that seemed to have no end.  I have received support from both classmates, TA's, and the instructor.  If you have any questions, please contact me through Slack.

I have include a few screen shots of the site below:
